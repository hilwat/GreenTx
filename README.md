##Notes to be improved but for now
First time - npm install 
Everytime start in commandline
$npm run compile:sass
firebase installed > firebase deploy  

##Still to do 
Go through check for alternative text - assessibility accessment etc.

Set up payment button using https://www.powr.io/plugins/paypal-button/standalone?id=19080202& will need their paypal info
